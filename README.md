# Algorithm-for-DNA-sequencing-Coursera
My works throughout the course "Algorithm for DNA sequencing" offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.
This includes some code given by the course followed by my modifications as well as my answers for some assignments.
One can freely access the content of "Algorithm for DNA sequencing" by auditing the course at https://www.coursera.org/, or at https://www.youtube.com/user/BenLangmead.
I truly appreciate any comments, suggestions or evaluations!

Cheers,
Ngoc
